## WorldTour - Concepts

In this section, you went used many of the previous components featured in Section One. Here’s just some of the highlights:

- We created a switchable button by switching a boolean value in the component and state to hide and unhide a menu component.

- The Pano component to represent different Virtual Reality worlds and environments.

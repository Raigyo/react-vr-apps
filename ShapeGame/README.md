## ShapeGame - Concepts

Letâ€™s overview the main components of this application:

- We can represent a collection of objects by using an array of numbers.

- By using the .map function, we can create lists of objects dynamically with an array.

- The AsyncStorage component allows for a local history of string key and value pairs.
